# Pondering Paths  

## The Root
- Understood the concept of tree filesystem and directories
- Used the `ssh -i ./key hacker@dojo.pwn.college` command to establish connection between the terminal and [pwn.college](https://pwn.college/) and then used `/pwn` to get the flag
  
  Flag Obtained- **pwn.college{oZPKIsYpmmn_gh0a3mq58cE2U_V.dhzN5QDL0YTN0czW}**
