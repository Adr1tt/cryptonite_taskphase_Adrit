# Pondering Paths  
Used the `ssh -i ./key hacker@dojo.pwn.college` command in the terminal to establish connection between the terminal and [pwn.college](https://pwn.college/)  

## The Root
- Understood the concept of tree filesystem(starting at /) and directories
- Started the challenge and entered `/pwn` in the terminal prompt to get the flag
  
  Flag Obtained- **pwn.college{oZPKIsYpmmn_gh0a3mq58cE2U_V.dhzN5QDL0YTN0czW}**
