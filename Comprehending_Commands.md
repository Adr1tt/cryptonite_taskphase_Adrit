# Comprehending Commands
Used the `ssh -i ./key hacker@dojo.pwn.college` command in the terminal to establish connection between the terminal and pwn.college
## cat: not the pet, but the command!
- Learnt the `cat` command which is used for reading out files and it can concatenate multiple files if multiple arguments are provided.

  Flag Obtained- **pwn. collegefQQ8pB_-WU8zzXXHNF5JWyhk2B1G. dFzN1QDLÂ®YTN0czW}**
## catting absolute paths
- Understood that we can specify cat's arguements as absolute paths.
- Started the challenge and entered `cat /flag` in the terminal prompt where /flag is the absolute path and thus obtained the flag

## grepping for a needle in a haystack
- Learnt the `grep` command and that it can be used for searching a file for lines of text containing a specific sequence of characters(string).
- Started the challenge and entered `grep pwn.college /challenge/data.txt` where "pwn.college" is the arguement since flags start with "pwn.college" and this obtained the flag

## listing files
- Learnt the `ls` command and that it will list files in all the directories provided to it as arguments, and in the current directory if no arguments are provided.
- Started the challenge and entered `cd /challenge` into the terminal prompt to change the directory and then used `ls` to list the files in the current directory.
- Two files showed up, then I used `./32713-renamed-run-12966` to run the file named "32713-renamed-run-12966" and thus obtained the flag

## touching files
- Learnt that we can create a new, blank file by touching it with the `touch` command.
- Started the challenge and entered `cd /tmp` into the terminal prompt and used `touch pwn` and `touch college` to create 2 files.
- Then used `ls` to check the created files and used `/challenge/run` to obtain the flag.

## removing files
- Learnt the `rm` command which is used to remove files.
- Started the challenge and entered `ls` which showed 2 files and one of them is "delete_me".
- Then I entered `rm delete_me` to remove that file and then entered `/challenge/run` to obtain the flag.

## hidden files
- Understood that Linux has a convention where files that start with a . don't show up by default in `ls` and we need to use `ls -a` to view them.
- Started the challenge and used `cd /` to change the directory(to /) and then used `ls -a` to show the hidden files.
- A file named ".flag-296222717518961" was shown and I used `cat .flag-296222717518961` to display its contents and thus obtained the flag

## An Epic Filesystem Quest
(This was a long one)
- Started the challenge and as instructed I used `cd /` and then `ls` to list files in the "/" directory.
- The following showed up in the terminal-  
  <img width="418" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/985dbda4-155a-4cd0-89fa-aa24778eaeef">  
- So I used `cat INFO` to read out the contents of the file "INFO" and the following showed up in the terminal-
  <img width="1007" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/83b60382-ce19-4992-bdc8-3b4a588c96e7">  
- So then I entered `ls /usr/share/javascript/mathjax/unpacked/jax/output/HTML-CSS/fonts/Gyre-Termes/Size1` in the terminal and 2 files were showed and one of them was "README-TRAPPED" so then, I used `cat /usr/share/javascript/mathjax/unpacked/jax/output/HTML-CSS/fonts/Gyre-Termes/Size1/README-TRAPPED` to reveal it's contents and this showed up-
  <img width="1020" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/323ef400-9f49-48df-b2ed-5566e70b3f36">  
- Then I used `ls /usr/share/autoconf/autotest -a` to reveal the hidden files and a file named ".TIP" came up. Then, I used `cat /usr/share/autoconf/autotest/.TIP` which revealed the next clue
  <img width="578" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b9336c31-e644-4355-9da0-b03b4aae8fb0">  
- Thus, I then entered `ls /opt/linux/linux-5.4/arch/parisc/kernel` in the terminal and many files came up, out of which I used the `cat` command on two files, first was a file named "Makefile" which revealed contents of no use and then I used the `cat` command on a file named "TRACE" which revealed the next clue-
  <img width="1873" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/88e65449-b596-4657-87a7-ca0f75e09a05">  
- Then I used `ls /usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/sympy/strategies/branch/tests` which revealed files and one of them was named "EVIDENCE", so I used `cat /usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/sympy/strategies/branch/tests/EVIDENCE` to reveal its contents and found the next clue
  <img width="886" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c0d955c-ba87-4b87-b634-27124bd99da0">  
- Therefore, I used `cd /opt/linux/linux-5.4/drivers/staging/uwb` and then used the `ls` command to list it's files and alot of files showed up and one of them was named "BLUEPRINT" and I used `cd BLUEPRINT` to output it's contents and found the next clue-
  <img width="1234" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/78360633-5a9b-49d6-8fa4-1c576fec96a6">  
- Now, I used `ls /opt/linux/linux-5.4/arch/nios2/include/uapi -a` and a file named ".MESSAGE" showed up on which I used the `cat` command to find the next clue-
  <img width="1010" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0cf8e650-fb20-42c9-a722-f0822c5be01c">  
- Now, I used `ls /opt/pt-dump/.git/logs/refs` which revealed multiple files out of which there was a file named "INSIGHT-TRAPPED". Thus I used `cat /opt/pt-dump/.git/logs/refs/INSIGHT-TRAPPED` and found the next clue-
  <img width="917" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c2050239-92c8-4ee2-9e5f-aaef8825d5bd">  
- Thus, I used `cd /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/jedi/third_party/typeshed/third_party/2/six/moves` to change directories and then used `ls` which revealed alot of files and one of them was named "SECRET".
- Now, I used `cat SECRET` which finally revealed the flag

## making directories
- Understood the `mkdir` command.
- Started the challenge and used `cd /tmp` to change directories and then entered `mkdir pwn` to make a new directory called "pwn" and then used `cd pwn` to change directories again.
- Then, I used `touch college` to create a new file called "college" and then used `/challenge/run` to obtain the flag-  
  <img width="421" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ae39fa5-3c2b-4623-99a8-e4f2d77d0abd">
## finding files
- Understood the `find` command which helps in searching for files and can take arguements which specify the search criteria or location.
- Started the challenge and used `find / -name flag` to search for all files named "flag" and the following output came up-  
  <img width="785" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/78876e94-5b15-4155-a0de-70e07b422ab4">  
- Then I tried using the `cat` command to read the files named "flag" one by one and found the flag on the fourth try

## linking files
- Understood the concept of a hard link and a soft link(symlink or symbolic link).
- Learnt the `ls` command and use of `ls -s`. Also I learnt about the `file` command which tells the type of a file.
- Started the challenge and entered `ln -s /flag /home/hacker/not-the-flag` in the terminal to create a symlink and then used `/challenge/catflag` to read out the symlink created to obtain the flag
